# Employee-Attrition-TwiLearn

Welcome to the Employee Attrition Analysis project! In this repository, we will explore and analyze an Employee Attrition rate Dataset provided by TwiLearn as part of an internship. The dataset contains valuable information on the employee salary and review data, and our goal is to uncover insights, trends, and factors to predict the attrition rates in the company. To achieve this, we will leverage the power of Python, using popular data analysis and machine learning libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-Learn.

**Problem Statement:**
As an intern at TwiLearn, our main objective is to perform a comprehensive analysis of the provided Employee Attrition rate dataset. We need to predict whether an employee will face attrition or not, based on the provided parameters.

**Solution:**
We will be applying classification algorithms on the dataset: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, SVM Classifier and KNN Classifier.

**Tools and Libraries**
* Python
* Google Colab
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-Learn
